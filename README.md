domx
====

DOMX is a javascript tool that allows you to explore the DOM of a webpage in browser. It is comparable to many of the tools that browsers have built in, but it is customizable.

Run this in your browser:

<pre>
javascript:document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src = 'http://dankuck.github.io/assets/loaddomx.js';void(0);
</pre>

I discuss it briefly in this blog post: <a href="http://dankuck.github.io/2014/04/17/domx.html">DOMX: Use It On Webpages</a>.
